                    <p class = "fontp">Congratulations on your engagement! We recommend that you contact us at least 4-8 months before your wedding to ensure availability. To begin the process, we’ll schedule a phone consultation to discuss the design details of your wedding. We love to see your Pinterest boards and inspiration images, too, so feel free to send those over prior to our phone call! After we’ve had a chance to discuss your wedding and our process, we’ll schedule a cake tasting and design consultation with Chef Madison.</p>
